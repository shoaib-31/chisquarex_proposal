# Chi SquareX Proposal

## <u>Navbar Style fix</u>

#### From:

![Initial-navbar](./navbari.gif)

#### To:

![Final-navbar](./navbarf.gif)

## <u>Side Style fix</u>

![Sidebar](./sidebar.gif)

#### Instead of popping up, it can be changed to be coming sliding from side like other standard websites

## <u>About Us Section</u>

#### It is so plain, its backbround can be cahnged to an svg background or make it like a card with a animation icon something like these:

<img src="brain.gif" alt="Alt text" width="200" height="200">
<img src="icon1.gif" alt="Alt text" width="200" height="200">
<img src="icon2.gif" alt="Alt text" width="200" height="200">

## <u>Services Section</u>

#### Cards are overlapping and also their look can be enhanced by adding a box shadow and also making icons in the centre from both sides

## <u>Providing Solutions</u>

#### The text in this section is very small and is not visible as such, it would be better if it will be a little bigger and bolder
